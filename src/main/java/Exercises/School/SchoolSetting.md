# School Setting

You are a very ambitious new comp sci teacher at a school. Since the director
has a lot of faith in you, he has given you the task of modelling the students and 
it's teachers. This is the following situation:

* Every student has a name, a grade and a list of subjects that he is taking.
* Every teacher has a name, a list of subjects that he is teaching and a list of students that he is teaching.
* Every person has a name and an age.
* Everybody has an address.

Your predecessor has already created the classes `Student` and `Professor` for you, and
an Interface Person.

After your  finished implementing, he is asking you to model it in UML.

You can create a new class if you think it is necessary.
