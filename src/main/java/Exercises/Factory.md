# Factory Exercise

You are an intern at an office equipment company. The boss told you to digitalize all of your company's warehouses, factory's and HQ.
The company currently has the following buildings:

- Warehouse, storing all the products
- 2x factory's, one producing 'rulers' and the other 'pencils'
- HQ, where all the business is done

The products are produced in the factory, stored in the warehouse and then shipped to the HQ to be sold.

You are provided with a toplevel interface 'Building' and a class 'Product'. You are to implement the following classes:

- Warehouse
- Factory
- HQ
- Pencil and Ruler

The 'Factory' class should have a method 'produceProduct' which returns a 'Product' object.
The 'Warehouse' class should have a method 'storeProduct' which takes a 'Product' object as a parameter.
The 'HQ' class should have a method 'sellProduct' which takes a 'Product' object as a parameter.
