# Test Skill

This section is to test your current skills. The number of the chapters, do are to be mistaken difficulty of the levels. They do not 
correspond to each other.
The range is from 1 to 5, with

[Level_1](Level_1.java)  being the easiest. You should be able to do the following:

* Know how to compile and run java through the command line.
* Know how to print out a statement using the `System.out.println()` method.
* Know when the general syntax of java, e.g.
``` 
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World") <-- would throw an error
    }
}
```

[Level_2](Level_2.java) contains:

* Know how to assign a variable.
* Know how to take inputs from the user with the terminal, e.g.
```
import java.util.Scanner;
```
* Know basic data types, e.g. `int`, `String`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`.
* Know how to cast data types, e.g. `int` to `double`, `double` to `int`.
* Know Operators, e.g. `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `&&`, `||`, `!`.

[Level_3](Level_3.java) contains:
* Know to use loops, e.g. `for`, `while`, `do-while`.
* Know to use conditional statements, e.g. `if`, `else`, `else if`.
* Iterate through arrays.
* Know switch statements.
* Basic knowledge of functions

[Level_4](Level_4.java) contains:
* Know how to use classes and objects.
* Know how to use constructors.
* Know how to use access modifiers, e.g. `public`, `private`, `protected`.
* Know how to use inheritance.
* Know how to use interfaces.
* Know to intertwine loops.

[Level_5]() being the hardest. You should be able to do the following:
* Know everything from the previous levels.
* How to model code.


I will provide the solutions to each chapter and code example and explain it. 
I recommend you to try it out first before looking at the solution... ;)
