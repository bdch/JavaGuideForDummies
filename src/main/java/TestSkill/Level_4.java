     *  Now, let's get to the real stuff:
     *  - I want you to create a class named 'Earth' in the same directory as this file. An earth has a name, a size, and a population.
     *  - The name should be a string, the size should be a double, and the population should be an integer.
     *  - Create a constructor that takes in the name, size, and population as arguments and sets the fields accordingly.
     *  - The earth has countries. Create a method that takes in a country name and its population and adds it to the earth's population and output it.
