     * - First, you have to create the main method.
     * - Second, you create a variable called 'radius' and assign a value of 5 to it.
     * - Third, you create a variable called 'area' and assign it.
     * - Lastly, you need to calculate the area of a circle using the formula: area = Math.PI * radius * radius and print the result.
     * 'HINT': You can use the import statement to import the Math class.
